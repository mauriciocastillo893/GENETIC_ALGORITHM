### VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
**First of all, I've created a virtual environment to be able to install the required dependencies using the next command line.**
`python -m venv <folder_name>`
*I chose "genetic_algorithm" as my folder_name*

**Now, whatever you want to run your application, you first need to activate the virtual environment because some dependencies into your software are required to start or run the code.**
*To activate:* `<folder_name>\Scripts\activate`
*To deactivate:* `deactivate`
